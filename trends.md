You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Based on the data I have observed:
-There is no obvious change in math or reaeding average pass rate by grade.

-spending per student appears to have a negative corralation with average scores

-schools with 2000 or more students have a lower average pass rate.

-Charter schools have higher average scores, especially in math. They also have a much higher overall pass rate.
